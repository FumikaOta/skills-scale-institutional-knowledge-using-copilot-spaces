# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This collection of process documents guides how we run projects—from initial idea to delivery and continuous improvement.

## Our Approach

OctoAcme's project management processes are built on these core principles:

- **Customer-first delivery**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision.
- **Iterative milestones**: We deliver small, testable increments to validate early and often.
- **Clear roles and ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead, with well-defined responsibilities across the team.
- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence and metrics.
- **Transparent communication**: We maintain open channels with stakeholders, regular updates, and a single source of truth for project status.
- **Risk management**: We proactively identify, assess, and mitigate risks throughout the project lifecycle.

## Documentation Guide

This documentation hub provides detailed guidance for each phase of the project lifecycle. Whether you're initiating a new project, planning execution, or conducting a retrospective, you'll find the templates, checklists, and best practices you need.
